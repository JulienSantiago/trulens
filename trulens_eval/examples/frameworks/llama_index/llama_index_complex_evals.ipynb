        "In this notebook, we will level up our evaluation using chain of thought reasoning. Chain of thought reasoning through interemediate steps improves LLM's ability to perform complex reasoning - and this includes evaluations. Even better, this reasoning is useful for us as humans to identify and understand new failure modes such as irrelevant retrieval or hallucination.\n",

        "Second, in this example we will leverage deferred evaluations. Deferred evaluations can be especially useful for cases such as sub-question queries where the structure of our serialized record can vary. By creating different options for context evaluation, we can use deferred evaluations to try both and use the one that matches the structure of the serialized record.\n",
