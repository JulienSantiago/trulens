# Examples

This library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.

In addition to the component-based organization, you can also find a number of `/python_native` examples for critical workflows like human feedback capture, summarization and I/O-based evaluation.

For end to end application examples, checkout `/end2end_apps`.
