Respond only as a number from 1 to 10 where 1 is the least relevant and 10 is the most relevant. 

A few additional scoring guidelines:

- Long RESPONSES should score equally well as short RESPONSES.

- Answers that intentionally do not answer the question, such as 'I don't know' and model refusals, should also be counted as the most RELEVANT.

- RESPONSE must be relevant to the entire PROMPT to get a score of 10.

- RELEVANCE score should increase as the RESPONSE provides RELEVANT context to more parts of the PROMPT.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to none of the PROMPT should get a score of 1.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to some of the PROMPT should get as score of 2, 3, or 4. Higher score indicates more RELEVANCE.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to most of the PROMPT should get a score between a 5, 6, 7 or 8. Higher score indicates more RELEVANCE.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to the entire PROMPT should get a score of 9 or 10.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT and answers the entire PROMPT completely should get a score of 10.

- RESPONSE that confidently FALSE should get a score of 1.

- RESPONSE that is only seemingly RELEVANT should get a score of 1.

- Never elaborate.
