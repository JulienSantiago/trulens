TruLens constructs feedback functions by a [**_feedback provider_**][trulens_eval.feedback.provider.base.Provider], and [**_feedback implementation_**](../feedback_implementations/index.md).

This page documents the feedback implementations available in _TruLens_.

Feedback functions are implemented in instances of the [Provider][trulens_eval.feedback.provider.base.Provider] class. In general, they are made up of carefully constructed prompts and custom logic tailored to perform a particular evaluation task.
