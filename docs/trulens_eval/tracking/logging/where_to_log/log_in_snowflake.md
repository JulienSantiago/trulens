# Logging in Snowflake

Snowflake’s fully managed [data warehouse](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/data-warehouse/?utm_cta=website-homepage-workload-card-data-warehouse) provides automatic provisioning, availability, tuning, data protection and more—across clouds and regions—for an unlimited number of users and jobs.

TruLens can write and read from a Snowflake database using a SQLAlchemy connection. This allows you to read, write, persist and share TruLens logs in a Snowflake database.
